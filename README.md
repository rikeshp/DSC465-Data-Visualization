# DSC465-Data-Visualization
Created explanatory and exploratory visualizations using R (tidyverse). Used packages/libraries such as ggplot2, tidyverse, ggbeeswarm, lattice, and dplyr.

## Homework 3
Last assignment involving more complex data visualization in R. Some of these include are density graphs and scatter plots with multiple variables visualized using area, hue, shade, etc.

## Final Project 

involved visualizing medical data sourced from healthdata.gov (https://healthdata.gov/dataset/nchs-potentially-excess-deaths-five-leading-causes-death). I was responsible for creating the final, comprehensive explanatory visualzation which was a vertically stacking of double line graphs to compare Percent Of Excess Deaths to Death Rate for each cause of death.
